### network-latency-exporter

**Important**: In some cases, TCP and UDP probes can show large packet loss not due to network problems, but due to system
settings. The `net.ipv4.icmp_ratelimit` kernel parameter with a default value of `1000` prevents a node from sending "
ICMP time in-transit exceeded" reply immediately, so `mtr` utility which is used in `network-latency-exporter` shows
losses.

Address **Important**: Please note that memory consumption by network-latency-exporter depends on number of nodes where
exporter will be installed and depends on number of using protocols.

The main formula is:

```bash
10Mi + (5Mi * (<number_of_nodes_in_cluster> - 1) * <number_of_protocols>)
```

_To avoid this behavior, set kernel variable `net.ipv4.icmp_ratelimit = 0` on all nodes._

For example: \"type: compute\"                                                                                                        | map[string]string                                                                                                            |

| annotations                   | Map of string keys and values stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. Specified just as map[string]string. For example: "annotations-key: annotation-value"    | map[string]string                                                                                                            |
| labels                        | Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. Specified just as map[string]string. For example: "label-key: label-value"                                          | map[string]string                                                                                                            |
| priorityClassName             | PriorityClassName assigned to the Pods to prevent them from evicting.                                                                                                                                                     | string                                                                                                                       |
