This guide contains information of how to configure TLS for ingress and route in Logging components.

# Ingress NGINX Controller With TLS

It can work with generated secret using `cert-manager` or with custom certificates.

# Route In Openshift

## Route Without TLS

```yaml
kind: Route
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
metadata:
  name: <specify-uniq-route-name>
  namespace: <specify-namespace-where-vmstack-is-installed>
spec:
  host: <specify-your-target-host-here>
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: vmauth-k8s 
    weight: 100
  port:
    targetPort: http
```

## Route With TLS

`Edge` Termination Type route will be auto generated alongwith Ingress, try to access route url.

To run `Reencrypt` routes please deploy monitoring without `Ingress` e.g.
`victoriametrics.vmAuth.ingress.install: false` (similarly for all ingresses)
and refer to the following templates as an example to manually create Openshift Routes:

```yaml
kind: Route
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
metadata:
  name: <specify-uniq-route-name>
  namespace: <specify-namespace-where-vmstack-is-installed>
spec:
  host: <specify-your-target-host-here>
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: vmauth-k8s 
    weight: 100
  port:
    targetPort: http
  tls:
    termination: reencrypt
    destinationCACertificate: <place-CA-certificate-here-from-created-TLS-secret>
    insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect
```

Example with reference for vmauth:

```yaml
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: vmauth-route
spec:
  host: <specify-your-target-host-here>
  tls:
    termination: reencrypt
    destinationCACertificate: |-
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      ...
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect
  path: /
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: vmauth-k8s
  port:
    targetPort: http
```

After creating above route if you got `net::ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS` error on the browser then one
of the possible root causes is there is HTTP traffic between balancers and the cluster which means route is
not added in whitelist of the balancer. To resolve the issue connect with INFRA team to add the route to
that list.

**Note:** We need to provide the CA certificate generated by `cert-manager` in the `destinationCACertificate` field, which
you can find under `Workloads > Secrets`. While we used `cert-manager` to obtain the certificates, it can also work
with custom certificates.
